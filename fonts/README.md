## Required Files

Place the following files in this directory:

### Season Serif (Display / Headings)
- `SeasonSerif-Regular.woff2`
- `SeasonSerif-Medium.woff2`
- `SeasonSerif-Semibold.woff2`
- `SeasonSerif-Bold.woff2`

## Licensing

These fonts are commercially licensed typefaces. Do not commit them to public repositories. Contact the design team for access to the font license files.

## Verification

Once you've placed the files here, open `index.html` in a browser. The yellow "Custom fonts not detected" banner at the top will disappear if the fonts load successfully.
